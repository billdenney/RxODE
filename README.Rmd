## Overview

**RxODE** is an R package for solving and simulating from ode-based
models. These models are convert the RxODE mini-language to C and
create a compiled dll for fast solving. ODE solving using RxODE has a
few key parts:

 - `RxODE()` which creates the C code for fast ODE solving based on a
   [simple syntax](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-syntax.html) related to Leibnitz notation.
 - The event data, which can be:
   - a `NONMEM` or `deSolve` [compatible data frame](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-event-types.html), or
   - created with `et()` or `EventTable()` for [easy simulation of events](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-event-table.html)
   - The data frame can be augmented by adding
     [time-varying](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-covariates.html#time-varying-covariates)
     or adding [individual covariates](file:///home/matt/src/RxODE/docs/articles/RxODE-covariates.html#individual-covariates) (`iCov=` as needed)
 - `rxSolve()` which solves the system of equations using initial
   conditions and parameters to make predictions
   - With multiple subject data, [this may be
     parallelized](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-speed.html).
   - With single subject the [output data frame is adaptive](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-data-frame.html)
   - Covariances and other metrics of uncertanty can be used to
     [simulate while solving](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-sim-var.html)

## Installation

You can install the released version of RxODE from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("RxODE")
```

To run RxODE, you need a working c compiler.  To use parallel threaded
solving in RxODE, this c compiler needs to support open-mp.

You can check to see if R has working c-compile you can check with:

```r
pkgbuild::has_build_tools(debug = TRUE)
```

If you do not have the toolchain, you can set it up as described by
the platform information below:

### Windows

In windows you may simply use installr to install rtools:

```r
install.packages("installr")
library(installr)
install.rtools()
```

### Mac OSX

Installation on a mac is much similar to RxODE installation under
windows.  To enable open mp on R and RxODE, you will need to install
the gfortran and clang compilers located at
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

### Linux

To install on linux make sure you install gcc (with openmp support)
and gfortran using your distribution's package manager.


## Development Version

Since the development version of RxODE uses StanHeaders, you will need
to make sure your compiler is setup to support C++14, as described in
the [rstan setup page](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started#configuration-of-the-c-toolchain)

Once the C++ toolchain is setup appropriately, you can install the
development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/RxODE) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nlmixrdevelopment/RxODE")
```
