\arguments{
\item{epsilon}{Precision of estimate for n1qn1 optimization.}

\item{maxInnerIterations}{Number of iterations for n1qn1
optimization.}

\item{n1qn1nsim}{Number of function evaluations for n1qn1
optimization.}

\item{method}{The method for solving ODEs.  Currently this supports:

\itemize{
\item \code{"liblsoda"} thread safe lsoda.  This supports parallel
           thread-based solving, and ignores user Jacobian specification.
\item \code{"lsoda"} -- LSODA solver.  Does not support parallel thread-based
      solving, but allows user Jacobian specification.
\item \code{"dop853"} -- DOP853 solver.  Does not support parallel thread-based
        solving nor user Jacobain specification
}}

\item{transitAbs}{boolean indicating if this is a transit
compartment absorption}

\item{atol}{a numeric absolute tolerance (1e-8 by default) used
by the ODE solver to determine if a good solution has been
achieved;  This is also used in the solved linear model to check
if prior doses do not add anything to the solution.}

\item{rtol}{a numeric relative tolerance (1e-6 by default) used
by the ODE solver to determine if a good solution has been
achieved. This is also used in the solved linear model to check
 if prior doses do not add anything to the solution.}

\item{maxstepsOde}{Maximum number of steps for ODE solver.}

\item{hmin}{The minimum absolute step size allowed. The default
value is 0.}

\item{hmax}{The maximum absolute step size allowed.  The default
checks for the maximum difference in times in your sampling and
events, and uses this value.  The value 0 is equivalent to
infinite maximum absolute step size.}

\item{hini}{The step size to be attempted on the first step. The
default value is determined by the solver (when hini = 0)}

\item{maxordn}{The maximum order to be allowed for the nonstiff
(Adams) method.  The default is 12.  It can be between 1 and
12.}

\item{maxords}{The maximum order to be allowed for the stiff (BDF)
method.  The default value is 5.  This can be between 1 and 5.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores used in parallel ODE solving.  This
defaults to the number or system cores determined by
\code{\link{rxCores}} for methods that support parallel
solving (ie thread-safe methods like "liblsoda").}

\item{covsInterpolation}{specifies the interpolation method for
    time-varying covariates. When solving ODEs it often samples
    times outside the sampling time specified in \code{events}.
    When this happens, the time varying covariates are
    interpolated.  Currently this can be:

\itemize{
\item \code{"linear"} interpolation (the default), which interpolates the covariate
    by solving the line between the observed covariates and extrapolating the new
    covariate value.
\item \code{"constant"} -- Last observation carried forward.
\item \code{"NOCB"} -- Next Observation Carried Backward.  This is the same method
      that NONMEM uses.
\item \code{"midpoint"} Last observation carried forward to midpoint; Next observation
  carried backward to midpoint.
}}

\item{printInner}{Integer representing when the inner step is
printed. By default this is 0 or do not print.  1 is print
every function evaluation, 5 is print every 5 evaluations.}

\item{printOuter}{Integer representing when the outer step is
printed. When this is 0 or do not print the iterations.  1 is
print every function evaluation (default), 5 is print every 5
evaluations.}

\item{scaleTo}{Scale the initial parameter estimate to this value.
By default this is 1.}

\item{derivEps}{Central/Forward difference tolerances, which is a vector
    of relative difference and absolute difference.  The central/forward
    difference step size h is calculated as:

        h = abs(x)*derivEps[1]+derivEps[2]}

\item{derivMethod}{indicates the method for calculating
derivatives of the outer problem.  Currently supports
"central" and "forward" difference methods.}

\item{...}{Other arguments including scaling factors for each
compartment.  This includes S# = numeric will scale a compartment
# by a dividing the compartment amount by the scale factor,
like NONMEM.}

\item{stiff}{a logical (\code{TRUE} by default) indicating whether
    the ODE system is stiff or not.

    For stiff ODE sytems (\code{stiff = TRUE}), \code{RxODE} uses the
    LSODA (Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations)
    Fortran package, which implements an automatic method switching
    for stiff and non-stiff problems along the integration
    interval, authored by Hindmarsh and Petzold (2003).

    For non-stiff systems (\code{stiff = FALSE}), \code{RxODE} uses
    DOP853, an explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 8(5, 3) of
    Dormand and Prince as implemented in C by Hairer and Wanner
    (1993).}

\item{tbs}{Type of transformation used on dependent variable and
prediction for dynamic transform both sides method.}
