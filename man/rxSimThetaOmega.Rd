\title{Simulate Parameters from a Theta/Omega specification}
\usage{
rxSimThetaOmega(params = NULL, omega = NULL, omegaDf = NULL,
  omegaIsChol = FALSE, nSub = 1L, thetaMat = NULL, thetaDf = NULL,
  thetaIsChol = FALSE, nStud = 1L, sigma = NULL, nCoresRV = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{Named Vector of RxODE model parameters}

\item{omega}{Named omega matrix.}

\item{omegaDf}{The degrees of freedom of a t-distribution for
simulation.  By default this is \code{NULL} which is
equivalent to \code{Inf} degrees, or to simulate from a normal
distribution instead of a t-distribution.}

\item{omegaIsChol}{Indicates if the \code{omega} supplied is a
Cholesky decomposed matrix instead of the traditional
symmetric matrix.}

\item{nSub}{Number between subject variabilities (ETAs) simulated.}

\item{thetaMat}{Named theta matrix.}

\item{thetaDf}{The degrees of freedom of a t-distribution for
simulation.  By default this is \code{NULL} which is
equivalent to \code{Inf} degrees, or to simulate from a normal
distribution instead of a t-distribution.}

\item{thetaIsChol}{Indicates if the \code{theta} supplied is a
Cholesky decomposed matrix instead of the traditional
symmetric matrix.}

\item{nStud}{Number virtual studies to characterize uncertainty in fixed parameters.}

\item{sigma}{Matrix for residual variation.  Adds a "NA" value for each of the 
indivdual parameters, residuals are updated after solve is completed.}

\item{nCoresRV}{Number of cores used for the simulation of the
sigma variables.  By default this is 1. This uses the package
\code{\link[mvnfast]{rmvn}} and \code{\link[mvnfast]{rmvt}}.
To reproduce the results you need to run on the same platform
with the same number of cores. This is the reason this is set
to be one, regardless of what the number of cores are used in
threaded ODE solving.}
