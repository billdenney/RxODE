\usage{
rxSplitLines(lhs, rhs, limit = 1100)
}
\arguments{
\item{lhs}{Left handed side to construct}

\item{rhs}{Right handed side to construct}

\item{limit}{the number of characters for the expression to be
before it is split.  By default this is 1100}
}
\value{
an expression where the lhs is constructed iteratively by
    splitting the lhs and adding it iteratively to the lhs.

For example:

lhs = 1 + 2 + 3

Would become

lhs = 1
lhs = lhs + 2
lhs = lhs + 3

When calling rxSplitLines("lhs", "1+2+3", 0)

This is to deal with the unwieldy lines that sometimes come out
of SymPy.
