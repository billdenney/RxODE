You can install the released version of RxODE from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("RxODE")
```

To build models with RxODE, you need a working c compiler.  To use parallel threaded
solving in RxODE, this c compiler needs to support open-mp.

You can check to see if R has working c compiler you can check with:

```r
## install.packages("pkgbuild")
pkgbuild::has_build_tools(debug = TRUE)
```

If you do not have the toolchain, you can set it up as described by
the platform information below:

### Windows

In windows you may simply use installr to install rtools:

```r
install.packages("installr")
library(installr)
install.rtools()
```

Alternatively you can
[download](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and install
rtools directly.

### Mac OSX

Installation on a mac is much similar to RxODE installation under
windows.  To get the most speed you need OpenMP enabled.  Here is some discussion about this:

https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/

### Linux

To install on linux make sure you install gcc (with openmp support)
and gfortran using your distribution's package manager.

## Development Version

Since the development version of RxODE uses StanHeaders, you will need
to make sure your compiler is setup to support C++14, as described in
the [rstan setup page](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started#configuration-of-the-c-toolchain)

Once the C++ toolchain is setup appropriately, you can install the
development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/RxODE) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nlmixrdevelopment/RxODE")
```
