* Move InfusionRate[] from global to local (per model). Remove
  limitation to 99 entries.

* eventTable(), expand the encoded/packed "evid" column 
  in the event table?  (e.g., provide columns flags for infusion vs 
  bolus, etc.)

* Define methods for EventTable objects (plot, points/lines, summary, 
  any other?)
