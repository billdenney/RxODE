# Mixing Solved Systems and ODEs.

In addition to pure ODEs, you may mix solved systems and ODEs.  The
prior 2-compartment indirect response model can be simplified with a
`linCmt()` function:

```{r}
library(RxODE)
## Setup example model
mod1 <-RxODE({
    C2 = centr/V2;
    C3 = peri/V3;
    d/dt(depot) =-KA*depot;
    d/dt(centr) = KA*depot - CL*C2 - Q*C2 + Q*C3;
    d/dt(peri)  =                    Q*C2 - Q*C3;
    d/dt(eff)  = Kin - Kout*(1-C2/(EC50+C2))*eff;
});

## Seup parameters and initial conditions

theta <-
    c(KA=2.94E-01, CL=1.86E+01, V2=4.02E+01, # central
      Q=1.05E+01,  V3=2.97E+02,              # peripheral
      Kin=1, Kout=1, EC50=200)               # effects

inits <- c(eff=1);

## Setup dosing event information
ev <- eventTable(amount.units="mg", time.units="hours") %>%
    add.dosing(dose=10000, nbr.doses=10, dosing.interval=12) %>%
    add.dosing(dose=20000, nbr.doses=5, start.time=120,dosing.interval=24) %>%
    add.sampling(0:240);

## Setup a mixed solved/ode system:
mod2 <- RxODE({
    ## the order of variables do not matter, the type of compartmental
    ## model is determined by the parameters specified.
    C2   = linCmt(KA, CL, V2, Q, V3);
    eff(0) = 1  ## This specifies that the effect compartment starts at 1.
    d/dt(eff) =  Kin - Kout*(1-C2/(EC50+C2))*eff;
})
```

Like a Sherlock Holmes on the case of a mystery, the `linCmt()`
function figures out the type of model to use based on the parameter
names specified.

Most often, pharmacometric models are parameterized in terms of volume
and clearances. Clearances are specified by NONMEM-style names of
`CL`, `Q`, `Q1`, `Q2`, etc. or distributional clearances `CLD`,
`CLD2`. Volumes are specified by Central (`VC` or `V`),
Peripheral/Tissue (`VP`, `VT`).

Another popular parameterization is in terms of micro-constants. RxODE assumes
compartment `1` is the central compartment.  The elimination constant
would be specified by `K`, `Ke` or `Kel`.

Once the `linCmt()` sleuthing is complete, the `1`, `2` or `3`
compartment model solution is used as the value of `linCmt()`.

This allows the indirect response model above to assign the
2-compartment model to the `C2` variable and the used in the indirect
response model.

When mixing the solved systems and the ODEs, the solved system's
compartment is always the last compartment.  This is because the
solved system technically isn't a compartment to be solved.  Adding
the dosing compartment to the end will not interfere with the actual
ODE to be solved.

Therefore,in the two-compartment indirect response model, the effect
compartment is compartment #1 while the PK dosing compartment for the
depot is compartment #2.

This compartment model requires a new event table since the
compartment number changed:

```{r}
ev <- eventTable(amount.units='mg', time.units='hours') %>%
    add.dosing(dose=10000, nbr.doses=10, dosing.interval=12,dosing.to=2) %>%
    add.dosing(dose=20000, nbr.doses=5, start.time=120,dosing.interval=24,dosing.to=2) %>%
    add.sampling(0:240);
```

This can be solved with the following command:

```{r,results="asis"}
x <- mod2 %>%  solve(theta, ev)
rxHtml(x)
```

Note this solving did not require specifying the effect compartment
initial condition to be `1`.  Rather, this is already pre-specified by `eff(0)=1`.

This can be solved for different initial conditions easily:

```{r,results="asis"}
x <- mod2 %>%  solve(theta, ev,c(eff=2))
rxHtml(x)
```

The RxODE detective also does not require you to specify the variables
in the `linCmt()` function if they are already defined in the block.
Therefore, the following function will also work to solve the same
system.


```{r,results="asis"}
mod3 <- RxODE({
    KA=2.94E-01;
    CL=1.86E+01;
    V2=4.02E+01;
    Q=1.05E+01;
    V3=2.97E+02;
    Kin=1;
    Kout=1;
    EC50=200;
    ## The linCmt() picks up the variables from above
    C2   = linCmt();
    eff(0) = 1  ## This specifies that the effect compartment starts at 1.
    d/dt(eff) =  Kin - Kout*(1-C2/(EC50+C2))*eff;
})

x <- mod3 %>%  solve(ev)
rxHtml(x)
```

Note that you do not specify the parameters when solving the system
since they are built into the model, but you can override the parameters:

```{r,results="asis"}
x <- mod3 %>%  solve(c(KA=10),ev)
rxHtml(x)
```
